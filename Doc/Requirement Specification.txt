1. Overview
    
    This is a memory game playable in any modern day browser.
    Technologies used for the game and it's presentation are: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

   The goal of this project is to provide a beautiful, easily accesibble, simple version of the classic memory game.
   Playing memory games can improve the player's short-term memory, dexterity, reaction time, precision and strategy.
   In many modern systems the developers focus on cramming in as much functionality as possible, often sacraficing performance,
   simplicity or accesibility. Our simple memory game provides a stress-free enviorement to play a game with no timers,
   no scores or leaderboards to minimize the potential of feeling rushed or judged.

2. Current State 
    here, write about why this game makes the world a better place...

3. Dream system
    this is some beyond our scope plan for the perfect product description IIRC

4. Functional requirements
    New Game - The New Game function generates 16 tiles with unique IDs and hidden background images upon pressing the New Game button on top of the screen
    ShowImg and HideImg - The ShowImg function reveals the given tile's hidden background image once the tile is clicked, the HideImg function changes the tile back to the original state
    Check Status - This function checks if the same tile has been clicked twice
    Hide Tile - Hides both tiles upon matching
    Flip - Handles tile flipping and matching logics, controls the amount of tiles that can be revealed at the same time

5. System rules, patterns, recommendations.
    For this project we are gonna be using HTML and CSS because it is a web based application
    and also Javascriot to handle the project's mechanics,
    like the dynamic tile generation when starting a new game.

6. Current business flow model.
    description of how the current system functions that we're trying to expand/replace? (how is this relevant with a 2 week project that makes a memory game? this is not building on anything we're just trying to get done with our assignment)

7. Required business flow
    description of the flow of using the program IIRC

8. List of requirements (redundant to 4.??)
    a list of functions, the "module" they're a part of, the function's name, it's version and what it does.

9. Reports
    basically a QnA for each function that lists expected outcomes of specified actions IIRC

10. Glossary
    technical words that appear in the project that might need explanations such as:
         "responsive interface means that the game screen will adapt to your screen's size and orientation" 

         IIRC - If I Read it Correctly
