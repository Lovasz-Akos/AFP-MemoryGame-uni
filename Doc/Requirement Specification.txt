1. Overview
    
    This is a memory game playable in any modern day browser.
    Technologies used for the game and it's presentation are: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

   {
        The game's interface consists of 6 by 6 tiles that have pictures assigned to them. 
        Clicking a tile reveals it's assigned picture. Clicking a second tile reveals it's assigned picture aswell,
        then checks if the pictures match up. If they do, the pair of tiles get removed, and the game can continue. If the tiles don't
        have matching pictures, their pictures are hidden again, and the game can continue.
        For the game to end, the player must find all the pairs, at which point no tiles remain.

        The "New Game" button resets the game to it's starting state and shuffles the assigned pictures.
   } --> should this block move to 4. or something?

   The goal of this project is to provide a beautiful, easily accesibble, simple version of the classic memory game.
   Playing memory games can improve the player's short-term memory, dexterity, reaction time, precision and strategy.
   In many modern systems the developers focus on cramming in as much functionality as possible, often sacraficing performance,
   simplicity or accesibility. Our simple memory game provides a stress-free enviorement to play a game with no timers,
   no scores or leaderboards to minimize the potential of feeling rushed or judged.

2. Current State 
    here, write about why this game makes the world a better place...

3. Dream system
    this is some beyond our scope plan for the perfect product description IIRC

4. Functional requirements
    list all the functions and what they do

5. System rules, patterns, recommendations.
    I have no idea.

6. Current business flow model.
    description of how the current system functions that we're trying to expand/replace? (how is this relevant with a 2 week project that makes a memory game? this is not building on anything we're just trying to get done with our assignment)

7. Required business flow
    description of the flow of using the program IIRC

8. List of requirements (redundant to 4.??)
    a list of functions, the "module" they're a part of, the function's name, it's version and what it does.
