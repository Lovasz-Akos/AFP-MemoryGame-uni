Game is consist of A 4 by 4 grid of squares that have pictures assigned, 
Goal of the game is to find all pairs in the game,
when we click a tile it reveals its assigned picture , after clicking two tiles program checks if both pictures
are same then both pictures will be removed else it remains hidden , and we continue untill we find pair of same pictures,
when we find all pairs then game is over , and we start again a new game with same process.
