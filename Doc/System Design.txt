1. Goal of the system
describes what the porgram aims to achieve

2. Project plan
lists contributors and their roles as well as the schedule and milestones

3. Business process model
desciption or diagram of the software's usage

4. Requirements
lists the program's goals that have to be met

5. Functional plan
User do not have any roles and duties,this game is completely for brain practice and test

6. Physical enviorement
describe the platfor the program was made for and what was used to create it

7. Architectural plan
The application's design was created via HTML and CSS. The HTML contains a wrapper
class that organizes all the tiles into a grid 4x4 grid layout. Tiles are using a
box named class and also a hover selector for that class which gives the tile its
design and simplicity. The 16 tiles are generated via Javascript, by using a for
loop, which makes it dynamic and able to give each tile its own unique ID.
The tiles' IDs are used to identify each tile in Javascript functions so it knows
which tile it's working with. Upon clicking a tile its onclick event calls the flip
function which increases the flipped tile counter by 1 and calls the showImg function
to reveal the hidden image on the selected tile's back by changing the background.
IF the same tile is selected twice nothing happens and that is because of the
checkStatus function. However if the second selection is not the same as the first
one the flipped tile counter increased by 1 again so no more tiles can be selected.
If the second tile matches the first selected one then hideTile function switches
both tiles' CSS classes to a class named hiddenBox which is supposed to hide boxes
from the user. If two tiles do not match they are reverted back by the hideImg
function to their default state which is the tile's front side with no images
displayed. The New Game button's onclick event calls the newGame function which sets
all tiles' backgrounds to empty and generates 16 new tiles with new images on the back. 

8. Implementation plan
For this web based project we used HTML to build the application's basic structure
then used CSS elements and classes to give it a simple and clean design anyone can
easily understand. Javascript was used to handle the game's mechanics, such as the
tile matching logic, tile flipping counter, flipping and hiding tiles via changing
certain elements' css classes and starting a new game by the click of a button.

9. Testing plan
during test stratgy,we need to test every function one by one,including API testing and system testing
the tester should have the ability to understand customers point of view,then we should test the whole
program,the goal is to test the whole program 100 times by the tester and no mistakes occure 

10. Install plan
Installing the software and Checking out the software once installed
Initializing databases and other software with site-specific data and Conversion from the current system, possibly involving running in parallel
Dry run of procedures in user manuals

11. Maintenance plan
the goal of this is to make sure that this program work properly ,as lone as any problem occure,the 
program will send a message about this problem,then we can solve it
