A 4 by 4 grid of squares that have pictures assigned. Goal of the game is to find all of the pairs.

Clicking a tile reveals it's assigned picture.

Clicking a tile while having one revealed, will reveal the second one and check if they match up.

If they do, both tiles are removed from the screen. If they don't, the pictures get hidden again and the next round starts.

If the player finds all the pairs, the game is over.

Clicking the "new game" button resets the game
